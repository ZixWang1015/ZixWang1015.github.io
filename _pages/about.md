I am a 1st year PhD student at the EIC College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Gaoyang Liu](https://gyliu1991.github.io). Previously, I worked as an NLP researcher student, focusing on LLM data privacy and security issues. I received my Bachelor's degree from Central China Normal University.

What's New
------
- [5/2025] Our paper “Decoupling Memories, Muting Neurons: Towards Practical Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models” got accepted in [ACL 2025 Findings](https://2025.aclweb.org/)!

- [3/2025] Our paper “Prototype Surgery: Tailoring Neural Prototypes via Soft Labels for Efficient Machine Unlearning” got accepted in [ACM CCS 2025](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/)!

My Research  Areas
------
- Privacy risks and Data Security Protection of Large Language Models
- Membership Inference Attacks on ML models
- Training Data Extraction or Recovering on LLMs
- Security of Large Reasoning Models and LLM Agents
