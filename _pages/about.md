I am currently a 1st year PhD student jointly trained by Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([HUST](http://www.hust.edu.cn/)) and PKU-Wuhan Institute for Artificial Intelligence([Âåó‰∫¨Â§ßÂ≠¶Ê≠¶Ê±â‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢](http://whai.pku.edu.cn/index.htm)).
I am working at the School of Electronic Information and Communications ([EIC](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/)), co-supervised by Prof. [Gaoyang Liu](https://gyliu1991.github.io) and Prof. [Wei Liu](https://faculty.hust.edu.cn/wliu/zh_CN/index.htm). 
I received my Bachelor's degree from Central China Normal University ([CCNU](https://www.ccnu.edu.cn/)) in 2022.
Previously, I work as an NLP researcher student, focusing on data privacy and security issues of LLMs and LLM Applications and Agents.
