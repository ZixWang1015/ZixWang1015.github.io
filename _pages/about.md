I am currently a 1st year PhD student at the EIC College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST-EIC), supervised by Prof. [Gaoyang Liu](https://gyliu1991.github.io) and Prof. [Wei Liu](https://faculty.hust.edu.cn/wliu/zh_CN/index.htm). Previously, I worked as an NLP researcher student, focusing on LLM data privacy and security issues. I received my Bachelor's degree from Central China Normal University (CCNU) in 2022.
